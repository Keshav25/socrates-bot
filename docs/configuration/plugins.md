# Plugin Configuration Files

All plugin configuration files are `.yml` files that need to be made manually. They need to be made in
the `config/plugins/` folder. Plugin configuration files need to be named after the main command name of their
respective commands. For example, if you are making a configuration file for the `>>slots` command, the configuration
file needs to be named `slots.yml`. They can not use command alternate names/aliases.

## Interaction Adding

The interaction addition configuration tells the bot where to send a message notifying the authors that a new
interaction has been submitted. This can be used as a safety protocol against malicious submissions, and a quick way to
remove bad submissions. If a bot owner reacts to one of these interaction log messages with an **❌** emote the bot will
remove it and react with **🔥** if it deletes it, that is, if the submission is found in the database and deleted.
**Note: This requires the `imgur` command to be set up.**

**Example of log message**:

**Configuration file contents**:

```yml
log_ch: 01234567890123456789
```

The `log_ch` key value needs to be an **Integer**.

> The file for storing this configuration is `addinteraction.yml`. You can obtain a channel's ID by using the `>>cid` command in that channel, or by targeting a channel with the same command. Or by activating Developer Mode in Discord's Appearance settings, right clicking the channel of your choice, and clicking Copy ID, the ID will be copied to your clipboard.

## Bot Development Suggestions

This function serves to have a global centralized suggestion channel where users can submit suggest changes they want
made to the bot. Usually development and feature wise. When someone uses the `>>botsuggest` command their suggestion is
sent to the bot suggestion channel, given a suggestion ID and stored in the database, as well as automatically given an
Arrow Up and Arrow Down emote reaction so users can vote on the suggestion. This ID, shown in the bottom left of the
suggestion message, can be used with the `>>declinesuggestion` and `>>approvesuggestion` commands which allow fast
responses to suggestions.

**Example of suggestion message**:

**Configuration file contents**:

```yml
channel: 01234567890123456789
```

The `channel` key value needs to be an **Integer**.

> The file for storing this configuration is `botsuggest.yml`. You can obtain a channel's ID by using the `>>cid` command in that channel, or by targeting a channel with the same command. Or by activating Developer Mode in Discord's Appearance settings, right clicking the channel of your choice, and clicking Copy ID, the ID will be copied to your clipboard.

## Suggestion Approval

This command automates a lot of stuff for developers when it comes to approving suggestions and adding them to a TODO
list. Well, GitLab honestly since that's what Lucia's Cipher uses. When the `>>approvesuggestion` command is used with a
suggestion ID the suggestion message in the suggestion channel is marked with a check mark and if GitLab repository
information is in the config it is also added as a new issue with a **Suggestion** tag.

**Example of suggestion issue**:

**Configuration file contents**:

```yml
token: 'gitlab_personal_access_token'
project: 123456789
```

The `token` key value needs to be a **String**, the `project` key value needs to be a **String** or an **Integer**.

> The file for storing this configuration is `approvesuggestion.yml`. The `token` which is a Personal Access Token can be obtained from your settings [here](https://gitlab.com/profile/personal_access_tokens). I'm not sure which scopes are required so I enable all of them. Just remember to never give that token to anyone no matter what. The `project` is the ID of the GitLab project. It can be found on your project page under the project's description, where it says:
`Project ID: XXXXXXX`. The `XXXXXXX` is what you want here.

## Cat Command

The `>>cat` command pulls images of cats from an external API. This API has a usage limit when used without an API key.

recommended to have.

```yml

dictionary API, and requires a key to use their features.

app_id: 'your_app_id'
app_key: 'your_app_api_key'
```

Both the `app_id` and `app_key` keys need to be **Strings**.

> The file for storing this configuration is `dictionary.yml`. You can obtain the application credentials from Oxford's developer page
[here](https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com/).

## Food Recipe

Unfortunately a tool for finding recipes was actually really hard to find. Or rather, a good and reliable, but free and
open one, to be precise. Sigma uses the Food2Fork API to search for recipes, and requires their API key.

```yml
api_key: 'my_f2f_api_key_here'
```

The `api_key` key value is a **String**.

## URL Shortening

For the `>>shortenurl` command, the Bit.ly API is used. By default and hardcoded, all links generated are ad-less simple
redirect URLs. To use this function a API key is required.

**Configuration file contents**:

```yml
access_token: 'my_access_token'
```

The `access_token` key value is a **String**.

> The file for storing this configuration is `shortenurl.yml`. The access token can be obtained from their official dev page
[here](http://dev.bitly.com/). You can generate a *Generic Access Token* once there.

[here](https://darksky.net/dev/account).

## Wolfram Alpha

Wolfram Alpha is one of the most amazing mathematics and statistics engines. Capable of processing extreme operations
and finding various data. Way beyond any of our capabilities, so we mooch off of them a bit, and use their API. To use
the `>>wa` command, you need their API key.

**Configuration file contents**:

```yml
app_id: 'your_app_id'
```

The `app_id` key value is a **String**.

> The file for storing this configuration is `wolframalpha.yml`. You can get the application ID at their API product page
