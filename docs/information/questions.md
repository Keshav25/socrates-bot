## Questions and Answers

- **Can I change Sigma's prefix?**
  > Yes, use the `>>prefix` command.

- **How can I use the commands in the Administration/Owner category?**
  > In short, you **can't**. These commands are limited to people who are hosting their own version of Sigma, on their own machine. You need to literally have Sigma **running on your computer as a program** to be able to do this. If you want to host your own version of Sigma, head over to the Setup section of this guide, everything is very precisely documented, straightforward and easy to follow, good luck!

- **Can I get into the list of owners on the official Sigma**
  > No.

- **My Kud earned didn't change when I won slots/race.**
  > As it says, it's Kud **earned**. Kud that you were given as a handout or that which you won with gambling doesn't go towards this. So Kud gained from slots, racing or from vault or user transfers does not influence this. Only Kud gained via minigames. Kud obtained via owner commands also doesn't affect this, so Kud you win during an event will not go toward your earned amount. **In short**: Gambling doesn't count and handouts don't count.

- **How do I enable NSFW commands?**
  > **Not Safe For Work** commands are available only in channels marked as NSFW. This is done from **within Discord**, not Sigma. Open the **settings of the channel** you want to enable them in, and tick the little **NSFW toggle** in said settings. If you still can't find it, see screenshots below.
