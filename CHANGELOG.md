# Apex Sigma Changelog

## 2019-02-12

### Changed

- Fixed the adopt response not being assigned to the response variable when targeting bots.

## 2019-02-09

### Changed

- No longer able to `>>adopt` bots.
- Clean the `.name` attribute of `AdoptableHuman` because fuck special characters.
- Have the `.name` attribute of `AdoptableHuman` update when they're interacted with.

## 2019-02-08

### Added

- The family tree functions have been added. You can `>>adopt` people, if you don't like them you can `>>disown` them. If you want to see your entire family tree from start to end use `>>familytree` and it will generate a nice little link with your entire tree in it. A thing to note that is that this mimics an actual biological family tree, meaning that you can't have more than 2 parents, cause biology.

### Changed

- Renamed all instances of the method `dictify()` to `to_dict()`. It's more uniform and logical.

## 2019-02-07

### Added

- The `>>sniff` interaction has been added. I have no official reason behind this besides liking the idea of lewd sniffs. Just being honest...

## 2019-02-05

### Added

- The `>>visualnoveldatabase` (I know it's long, use `>>vndb` or `>>vn` instead) command was revived. Now with 100% less locks and 100% more async. It looks up visual novels, obviously.

## 2019-02-04

### Changed

- Fixed the `>>spelledlike` command. That issue was there for a long time but nobody really uses this command...
- The `>>shadowpollvote` command will now try to delete the vote command message.

## 2019-02-02

### Changed

- Hardmute ongoing message deletion safeguard. By *Shifty*.
- Music playing notification edit safeguard. By *Shifty*.
- Replace aiohttp exceptions to reduce imports. By *Shifty*.

### Removed

- Disabled `>>yomomma` while a replacement endpoint is found. By *Shifty*.

## 2019-01-25

### Added

- The item dialogue function has been created.

### Changed

- Moved the changelog note to the bottom of the document.
- Item finding professions are now more interactive. They require the user to select a correct icon for the fish/plant/animal they are catching for it to succeed instead of just typing the command.
- Fish rarity 7 and plant rarity 7 icons have been swapped. Makes more sense for a fish to use the "fish cake" icon.

## 2019-01-24

### Added

- Selling your entire inventory or selling items with a filter will trigger a confirmation dialogue for the user to confirm their sale.
- The bool dialogue generator now takes a `tracked: bool` argument that records how long the user took to respond.

### Changed

- The interaction addition is now a whitelist mechanic. Instead of being able to remove submitted interactions with an `❌` emote reaction to the log message, you now approve it instead with a `✅`. Unless approved, the interaction will not be used. Sigma will then add a `🆗` reaction of her own if successfully approved.

## 2019-01-22

### Changed

- Server renamed to Support in the `>>help` command and make the command link lead to the website once again.
- Fix the invite URL in the `CONTRIBUTING.md` document and remove the nonexistent setup link.
- Suggestion approval and declining commands return an `ok` response if the user was not found or if the notification was undelivered, specifying the lookup or delivery failure.
- Shortened the `status_clockwork(ev: SigmaEvent)` lines for caching the status files.
- Placed `.get()` methods in `afk_mention_check.py` to combat possible (but unlikely) `KeyError` instances.
- Refactored `module.yml` files automatically for visual alignment and clarity.
- The `>>youtube` command was repaired by *Shifty*.

## 2019-01-19

### Changed

- Remove logger creation from the `ExecutionClockwork` class as it was unused.
- The logger files contain shard numbers in them in the format of `sigma.{shard}.{date}.log`.
- The way the `>>play` command executes the `>>summon`, `>>queue` and `>>donate` commands are executed now use their raw methods instead of the `.execute(pld: CommandPayload)` method of the `SigmaCommand` class.
- Generic responses implementation by *Shifty*, second pass.

## 2019-01-18

### Changed

- Generic responses implementation by *Shifty*, first pass.
- Fixed extention blocked incompatibility with the Payload system by *Shifty*.

## 2019-01-10

### Added

- The `>>crates` command for searching crates.io Cargo/Rust packages.

### Changed

- Fix CHANGELOG.md dates and alter styling. Poor me was still stuck in 2018.

## 2019-01-09

### Added

- Generic core utility for making async HTTP requests created with the `aioget(url: str, as_json: bool)` coroutine.
- Add the `error(content: str)` generic response method.

### Changed

- Blockers/filters now check for the `administrator` permission in `guild_permissions` instead of `permissions_in(channel)`.
- Change invite blocking functions default value for the `invite_found` variable from a `bool` to a `None`.
- Remove the `>>prefix` command minimum length limit of 2 characters.
- Fix the `>>donate` command's missing (incorrect) argument.

## 2019-01-08

### Changed

- Disable caching of blacklist items. Those are user, server, module and command blacklist entries.
