    description: Makes your pumpkin grow.
      The default value it uses is 10
      but you can input any amount of sweets you want to use.
      You'll be prompted if you agree. The amount of weight the pumpkin
      gains is a positive exponential. The more sweets you give it in a bulk
      the more weight it gains. So stock up on sweets and dump it all on it at once.
