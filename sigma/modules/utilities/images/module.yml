      Or you can add "auto" to show the predominant color of the image.
      You can also add "static" to the end to make it return the full sized static version of your avatar.

    usage:        "{pfx}{cmd} Monika"
    description:
      Searches for an emoji. You can use the actual emoji or just its name.
      If you use its name you can make the search more precise by adding
      the ID of the emote or server ID that the emote is from, like in this
      example "monika:375824498882117635". Custom emotes are not guaranteed
      to be SFW as they can be anything.
