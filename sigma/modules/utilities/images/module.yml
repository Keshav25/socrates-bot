                  Shows the mentioned user's avatar.
                  If no user is mentioned, it shows the author's avatar.
                  You can add "gif" to the end of the command to indicate that it's a gif.
                  Or you can add "auto" to show the predominant color of the image.
                  You can also add "static" to the end to make it return the full sized static version of your avatar.

    usage:        "{pfx}{cmd} Monika"
    description:
                  Searches for an emoji. You can use the actual emoji or just its name.
                  If you use its name you can make the search more precise by adding
                  the ID of the emote or server ID that the emote is from, like in this
                  example "monika:375824498882117635". By default this searches emotes on the current server.
                  If you wish to search emotes on all servers, add "--global" as the last argument. Note that this
                  makes the command NSFW due to the possibility of other server's emotes being explicit.
