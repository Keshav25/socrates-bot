    description: Shows statistical data for the given resource type. You can use the
      bot's currency name instead of "currency", like "kud" for example. Resources also
      include "experience" and "cookies". The command will show where you got that resource.
      From which user, which server, which channel and with which function. Only "earned"
      resources are tracked however, meaning that there's no data on gambling. You can
      also add "--expense" to the end of the command to see where you spent that resource
      instead of showing where you got it as well as target a user with the command
      to see their stats. You can see all available resources with the "resourcelist"
      command.
