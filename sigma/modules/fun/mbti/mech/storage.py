    'p2': 'This self-report inventory takes into account one’s likes, dislikes, strengths, weaknesses, possible career preferences, as well as compatibility with other personality types. Such information provides insight into methods for self-actualization and personal development.',
    'p3': 'Each of the sixteen MBTI personality types are comprised of a combination of eight cognitive functions, originally developed by Jung. These eight functions are crucial to understanding how one interacts with both internal and external stimuli, and are beneficial to know as a tool to assist in further analysis and consideration of how one operates.'

This may allow them to share in part of a friend’s feelings as their friend describes a situation they feel particularly strongly about. The FeNi will feel true indignation, joy, anger, etc. on behalf of others, making them master empathizers. Those around the FeNi will typically describe them as warm, caring people, and great friends.',
        'p2': 'FeNi’s use their Ni to intuitively know what needs to be done before it may even become a real issue. They tend to exhibit a natural foresight, anticipating needs 10 steps before others do. come from a perspective of looking 10 steps ahead of others, and can see the need before others do. They might even feel that people don’t appreciate what they do because they do something before the need is actually there. They might also refrain from taking an action they know someone needs because they don’t want to seem presumptuous. Because FeNi’s enjoy helping people and get energy from meeting people’s needs, FeNi individuals should be careful to surround themselves with good-willed, honest people so as to not “give” themselves to death.',
        'p3': 'The FeNi spends a good deal of their internal thought life thinking about relational issues—how their actions affect others and how they feel about what others said to them. They often realize after the fact that something they said could have been taken in a way they did not intend, which can cause them to worry that they might have unintentionally hurt or offended someone. They spend a lot of time thinking about future possibilities like their goals and aspirations. They might not think about these things in a step-by step way. Rather, they want to explore different possibilities of where their goals and interests might lead them.'

The more diverse their learning and exploring is, the more likely it is that they can find a unique solution to a problem by pulling from their library of knowledge or understanding.',
        'p2': 'NeFi’s are extremely self-aware and spend a good deal of time on self-reflection. They are very concerned with the depth and nuances of their values system and spend a large amount of their mental space clarifying, sifting, and refining their beliefs. This process can be very connected to deep emotions for NeFi’s. They might find themselves laughing or crying at the beauty of a seemingly random object that has meaning to them, while bystanders who notice their reaction might be quite confused at their sudden outburst. For some NeFi’s, their emotions run so deep that there have to have been a lot of feelings building under the surface for quite some time before they will burst forth. They tend to seek out things (movies, books, etc.) that will engage their emotions, because following characters they care about through an emotional journey can be very rewarding for them.',
        'p3': 'The NeFi’s instinct is to achieve inner harmony by remaining true to themselves, their own values, and minimizing the influence that external factors (societal expectations, and maybe even the opinions of friends and family) have on their values. They may love discussing their values with others, as long as they are able to remain true to themselves while doing so.',
        'p4': 'NeFi’s find their own principles to be trustworthy and valuable, and are inherently skeptical of  others that try to impose on them. If something does not line up with their beliefs, they cannot act in accordance with it. To go against their own values is to cause inner discord, which NeFi’s can’t tolerate for long.'

        'p1': 'TeNi’s are very goal-oriented and results-driven. When they’re at their best, you aren’t likely to see them continue with an inefficient method for long. They tend to dislike getting into the dirty details of implementation and are likely to delegate as much as possible to others. It’s very obvious to a TeNi what is or isn’t going to work, and it can be frustrating when others don’t see solutions as obviously as they do. TeNi’s may be accused of being bossy or critical at times, but it’s important to note that they typically won’t bother correcting someone unless they value that person and/or their work. Although people might complain about the bossiness of a TeNi, the truth is that those around them would be usually be lost without their effective leadership.',
        'p2': 'Although TeNi’s are very social people, they are not afraid of being disliked in most cases. They don’t shy from necessary confrontation and when it comes to interpersonal conflict, they are apt to want to resolve issues in a quick, efficient manner and then move on with life. Only when they feel someone has wronged them or wounded them very deeply will they feel the need to cut people out of their life. In most instances, they prefer to resolve an issue and move on, without lingering too much in any emotional aspects of conflict.',
        'p3': 'TeNi’s have a deep internal world that is often hard for them to put into words or share with others. Ni is their main source of creativity. They are very intuitive and can often see all the possibilities for how a particular situation will play out. They are then able to analyze all the options and refine them down until they arrive at what they feel is the most likely one. Their inner world is constantly shifting and changing and analyzing different aspects of things. When they make plans or have a goal in mind, they are naturally able to skip ten steps ahead to see how it might turn out.'

They derive satisfaction from learning about a huge variety of topics so they can use the information to fuel their ideas. The more diverse their learning is, the more likely it is that they can find a unique solution to a problem by pulling from their library of knowledge. They are commonly known as polymaths, or renaissance men/women because of the variety of topics they learn about. They generally prefer to obtain competence in many areas rather than mastering just one skill or area of expertise.',
        'p2': 'NeTi’s get their ideas from the world around them and their ideas usually flow best when they have someone to bounce ideas off of. This is the nature of Ne and other external functions (denoted by the lowercase “e”) - they need interaction with the world to function optimally. This is a double-edged sword, as the outside world can also be highly distracting. Because of this, they tend to need alternating stages of input and output.',
        'p3': 'NeTi’s tend to be curious about people, but having to constantly care for others can drain them quickly. They love studying people and brainstorming with them, but their default is often to try and problem-solve for people when they’re upset rather than only listening to them. It can take some direct instruction from others before the NeTi learns what is appropriate in terms of responding to others who are in emotional pain. They may also start to feel uncomfortable around overly emotional people, and can have a strong desire for the other person to just feel better so things can be normal again.',
        'p4': 'NeTi’s are constantly taking in information and turning it over in their minds, looking at it from every angle and thinking about how it relates to everything else they’ve learned. They regularly ask “how does this work?” and “why is it like this?”  as their Ti filters and processes their discoveries to separate out what is useful or not useful, accurate or not accurate.'

        'p1': 'FeSi uses Fe to “read” the vibes of everyone in the room and is constantly keeping tabs on what everyone seems to be thinking and feeling. They subconsciously take in all this information, and make most of their choices based on this info, which essentially boils down to, “What can I do that will benefit the most people?” At the same time, the FeSi also uses their own mannerisms, expressions, emotions, and capabilities to influence and help others around them. When the FeSi gets good vibes, feelings, or a sense of something that sparks their interest from another person or group of people, they build on that expression and mirror it back to the person or group.',
        'p2': 'FeSi’s tend to be especially intelligent when it comes to reading facial expressions and body language. When they scan the room, they subconsciously take in the “aura” or “feeling” that radiates from each individual person. In the mind of an FeSi, this process categorizes the “feeling” gleaned from each person and notes the person’s facial expression, gesticulations, body placement, etc. and stores them away to be accessed and pulled from later.',
        'p3': 'FeSi’s are very concrete inside—they have a sense internally that their world is very black and white; ‘right’, and ‘wrong’. Because of this, FeSi’s can be incredibly hard on themselves. They tend to set very high standards for themselves, because they believe that anything less is unacceptable. FeSi’s can use this to their advantage to create things with excellence, but they should be careful not to get so caught up in it that they don’t actually put anything out there because they feel it isn’t good enough, or become so focused on making things perfect that they lose sight of what actually matters.'

It’s possible that those with strong Se are the only people who truly live ‘in the moment’, in a sense. They view the world as a solid force, and prefer to take in information in a concrete, solid way. Because they do not experience solidity within themselves, they seek that stability in the world around them.',
        'p2': 'SeFi’s especially feel that every moment should be spend on something worthwhile and fun, and doing anything they view as ‘work’ is arduous and tedious, even if it’s work they enjoy. They are all about having fun and experiencing new things, so even enjoyable work is rarely a favorite activity for them. They want to be able to do exactly what they want to do, the moment they think of doing it. Anything that hinders that freedom is a frustrating block to their Se.',
        'p3': 'While they can be great listeners, SeFi’s really enjoy doing things with people as a means of getting acquainted. They crave thrill and adventure and need to be engaged with the world around them. Exploring nature, getting involved in physical sports, or getting their hands dirty and doing things in the physical world is very cathartic for them.',
        'p4': 'At their best, SeFi’s are masters of self-care and great at putting healthy boundaries in place. They are empathetic people, so they see the needs of others and want to take care of them when they can. However, healthy SeFi’s know that they cannot effectively care for others unless they first care for themselves. They know their limits and aren’t usually afraid of saying ‘no’ when they aren’t able to do something or fit something into their lives.'

This is not to say they’re all perfectly tidy, but when it comes to something that matters, they plan, organize, and execute their plans in a very linear fashion. When they put their all into a project and have the right tools and resources, you can be sure it will be very well executed.',
        'p2': 'TeSi’s are great at seeing areas for improvement in people’s lives. Because highly detailed systems naturally make sense to them, they may see a problem someone is having and try to help the person implement their own system as a solution. When they’re younger, they might try to apply their solutions to any potentially relevant problem they come across, thinking, “If it works for the me, of course it should work for the person I’m helping!” As they gain more experience in life, they learn to recognize when their help is welcome and where their solutions are actually a good fit, and they become a lot more strategic about the way they help people.',
        'p3': 'TeSi’s tend to have very high standards for themselves, which can cause them to focus on where they feel they’re falling short, even though those around them rarely demand the near-perfection they demand of themselves. Because they can be very driven and often end up in leadership roles where they’re the pioneer, it can get exhausting if they’re in a role where most of what they hear is negative feedback. Being a leader causes all their flaws to become more visible, and the perception most people have of TeSi’s is that they have no feelings at all. This can cause employees and even family members to be unnecessarily harsh in the way they speak to and about TeSi’s.'

        'p2': 'SeTi’s need a certain level of impulsiveness in life to be happy. While they don’t absolutely abhor schedules, it does get irritating for them when a schedule becomes more important than doing the things a schedule is supposed to allow time for. They also might break the rules from time to time, but not necessarily to rebel or make a point. They simply don’t think in terms of rules and procedures. Their focus is on actions that will accomplish specific things.',
        'p3': 'SeTi’s really enjoy doing things with people as a means of getting acquainted. They crave thrill and adventure. Exploring nature, getting involved in physical sports, or getting their hands dirty and doing things in the physical world is very cathartic for them. The Se side of an SeTi makes them value beauty very highly, and they are likely to seek out beautiful, serene surroundings, especially in nature. Their surroundings have a strong influence on them, and they are very aware of their physical environment.',
        'p4': 'SeTi’s are excited about the here and now of what is going on around them. They are very present, and might find it difficult to plan far into the future. They are so fully present in the moment that the current situation they find themselves in feels like it’s their whole world. If you were to ask an SeTi what their life is like, they may tell you about their current circumstances rather than the big picture.'

        'stack': 'ni-fe-ti-se',
        'p1': 'NiFe’s tend to have a rather large “working memory,” meaning that they can retain active consciousness of a large number of facts or details for immediate use. In the short term, they can have a remarkably accurate memory showing a great attention to detail, while still retaining the big picture. However, if they spend too much time trying to hold multiple perspectives and a wide array of details in their mind, they will suffer from internal overstimulation; this can even lead to moments of panic or feeling trapped inside of one’s head. It can also be a huge killer of the NiFe’s natural creativity.',
        'p2': 'The presence of Fe in an NiFe’s life is often experienced as a blessing and a curse. When they sense the emotions of other people, Ni’s vague, impressionistic nature often means that they don’t always clearly perceive origins and reasons for their emotional impressions. This is especially true for young NiFe’s who may not be able to clearly define why they dislike being around certain people or put in certain situations. It is the development of Ti  that allows them to retrace the steps that Ni traversed subconsciously.',
        'p3': 'They overwhelmingly feel that their inner world is vastly more fascinating and colourful than the world around them, and they struggle to convey anywhere near the level of detail, beauty, or simply the humor of what they’re experiencing in their mind in a way that does it justice. Too much time being forced to engage with the real world can get really exhausting for NiFe’s. Finding ways to minimize this drain is a good way to allow them to focus their creative abilities on the things they are best at.'

It’s important that they gain the self-awareness needed to know the difference.',

They tend to be more at ease communicating through images, sound, written word, or some other form of expression where they are able to explore the full depth of an idea and expand on it before presenting it to public scrutiny.

SiTe’s, often without noticing, pay a lot of attention to how things that engage their 5 senses (seeing, hearing, tasting, seeing, smelling) affect them. They value their own experiences very highly, and typically have a very good memory or catalogue of details about them. They tend to store their impressions of experiences rather than direct memories of the experiences themselves. They use this information to help them make the best decisions possible in the future.',
        'p3': 'Despite some popular stereotypes, SiTe’s do change their minds, though it might take longer for them than for other types. They often have a quirky sarcastic sense of humour and care deeply for those close to them, though they are far more likely to show their love in practical ways rather than being sappy and overly affectionate.',
        'p4': 'SiTe’s manage concrete practical information more easily than abstract concepts. Because they are linear thinkers, they naturally ask themselves “What is the next step?”, and because they are detail-oriented, they are often able to manage or design highly complex systems and highly detailed projects with incredible grace.',
        'p5': 'SiTe’s tend to have very high internal standards for themselves, which can cause them to focus on where they feel they’re falling short, even though those around them probably don’t demand the near-perfection they demand of themselves. At times they may even get fixated on doing things “right” according to the rules they’ve internalized about how the world works, and in their younger years it’s not uncommon for them to try to impose these rules on their kids or people they’re trying to help.'

Many TiSe’s do care deeply about social issues and the welfare of their communities, they just don’t usually have the emotional stamina to be “touchy feely” with more than a handful of people who are close to them.'
