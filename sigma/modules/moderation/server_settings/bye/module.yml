      Toggles whether bye messages are an embed or not. Also customizes the embed that is used.
      You can change the embed color, set the thumbnail, and set the image. To do so, specify the
      field and the value separated by a colon (see usage example). The accepted fields are color,
      thumbnail, and image. Color accepts only HEX codes, while the other two accept only direct
      image URLs. Provide no arguments to toggle this feature on or off.
