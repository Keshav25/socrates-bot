    description: Purchases an item from the open market.
      By default, if you use the item name, it will give you the cheapest listing.
      Otherwise, you can use a market entry token that sellers get when they list an item on the market.
      You can also use this command to retrieve an item you listed from the market, which is free and ignores taxation.

      - "msell"
    description: Lists an item you have to be sold on the open market.
      When the item is successfully listed, you will get a market entry token.
      You can share that token with others so they buy your listing directly.
      Selling items on the market does not contribute to your ranked Kud.
