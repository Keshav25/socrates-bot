      A trivia minigame.
      You are given a question and have to input the number of your answer.
      Guess correctly and you win 10-50 Kud (base), depending on the difficulty.
      You have 20 seconds to answer the question. Consecutive correct answers give you a streak
      and the streak increases the Kud gained for each correct answers. Timing out or giving an incorrect
      answer resets the streak. You can choose the category and difficulty of the question
      like in the usage example, but choosing either will disable the streak.
